When I was a child, I always want to be a master on everything. I wanted to get all high scores on every subjects in school; I wanted to play game better than anyone around me; I even thought one day I may be as good as a president to lead the country. Since I was at grade three, my Chinese literature score was just around average. No matter how many training courses I took to improve essay writing, I was still there. But I still thought I can be good at all other subjects in school. In fact, although I don't want to admit, the life in school taught me I cannot be the top student in all courses, not only Chinese literature. I may even cannot be the best one in Chemistry after the secondary school. But it did not mean that we should stop struggling. Yesterday, after reading the essay in his new book (Chinese version), I realised I can \"be just perfect\". I am just to the point that I am capable to do something but not 100% perfect (and there should not be any 100% perfect ability). If I am so good at everything, what should I do? Nobody can do everything since life is so short. Will it be a waste that these gifts are on myself? I think I would be panic if I am so talent but I cannot help everyone or I cannot make any accomplishment in the whole life. With his words, I find I am quite satisfied with my life even I am not a millionaire (at least till now). Sometimes, I even have pity on some people born with talent. It means they would be deemed to do something different even they may just want a normal life.

As past, I made some plan in mind or paper but most of them were just staying there. Occasionally, I saw someone put some specific plans on her blog summary and realised I have never put any plans publicly. It will never be to late to do so, so here the mid-year plan comes. Review Past half year summary: Blog written: 1 Book read: 12 Courses finished: 1 Distance run: < 50km Gathering organised: 1 This result does not looks so good. Since I started working, my belly becomes fatter and it seems to be easier to be fat compared with the time in university. It becomes a concern to me since I don't want the be as fat as my father when I come to 40's. I don't want to be a skinny person without muscles when I come to 60's. Plan In the next half year, I want to improve myself at least in the field mentioned before. Blog: at least write 1 per month, ideal 1 per week Book: at least read 2 per month, ideal 1 per week Courses: at least finish 2 basic language learning (python and javascript), ideal 1 advanced level. LaTeX must be at advanced level. Running: at least 5km per week, ideal 50km per month Workout: at least 2 times per week, ideal 4 times per week Gathering: at least 1 per month, ideal 2 per month I also want to add playing badminton, playing tennis, playing table tennis and swimming to the list, but these could be limited by other external reasons. This should not be hard to accomplish once I stick to the plan I made. I need to review this plan every week to see how it goes.

Package control install If you are installing LaTeXTools for the first time, you need to create a configuration file, LaTeXTools.sublime-settings , in your User directory (off the Packages) directory.

Basic Operations Most LaTeXTools facilities are triggered using Ctrl-l (Windows, Linux) or Cmd-l (OS X), followed by some other key or key combination. Compiling LaTeX files Keybinding: Cmd-b Multi-file documents : first line in the current file consists of the text %!TEX root = <master file name> . TeX engine selection : first line of the current file consists of the text %!TEX program = <program> . 'pdflatex' is the default. For multi-file documents, the directive must be in the root file. Tips Forward Searching : C-l,j Reverse Searching : Cmd+shift+click in Skim, noble-clicking in Sumatra. Jumping to sections and labels : C-r commands and environments : C-l,c for commands and C-l,e for environment. Wrapping : C-l,C-c wraps the selected text in a LaTeX command structure, e.g. blah to \\cmd{blah} . Then tab to the end of command. C-l,C-e gives you \\emph{blah} , and the cursor moves to the end of the command.

You can check weather your terminal environment is in UTF-8 by $ locale . If not, you can temporarily change it by: $ export LC_ALL = en_US.UTF-8 $ export LANG = en_US.UTF-8 To change it persistently, you need to add above command in ~/.profile .

To generate the site locally, you can run command: $ make devserver It serves your site to http://localhost:8000 . You can preview the website locally first. Or you can just generate html without testing $ make html No matter which method you choose, some .html file will be generated in folder output . To debug easily and for the future convenient, I recommend to new a folder under blog, e.g. /blog/gitblog and copy the files in output to this folder. Why? I will explain later. Upload the pages Since all the html files are prepared, we only need to upload them to our GitHub. These part should be done after you have a basic knowledge of GitHub . If you have already created README file in GitHub, you may need to add $ git pull origin master before $ git add . . $ cd gitblog $ git init $ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io $ git add . $ git commit -m \"first commit\" $ git push -u origin master You may need to input GitHub username and passward if you do not use SSH key introduced in Chapter GitHub . If no error, you can visit you blog by username.github.io. If you are as lazy as me, you can also use make github directly after make html . Modify and update pages The reason to create another folder instead using output to upload pages is that every time you use $ make html , output will be replaced with new files. Thus, it would be better to copy the files from output into gitblog before uploading. Here is some commands for delete and update files: $ git rm ×××.html $ git add . $ git commit -m \"some message\" $ git push -u origin master Summary This article is only the introduction of setting up a personal blog by using GitHub and Pelican .
